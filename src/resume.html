            Worked in several teams of designers, developers, and project managers to build products and websites for clients across a wide variety of platforms and technologies.

          <p>
            As a lead frontend engineer I worked on two major initiatives.
            The first was to build a new modern WordPress theme which was rolled out to over 2000+ websites on the product platform.
            The new theme added responsive support and extensive customizations resulting in a significant increase of traffic.
            The second initiative was to optimize the company's advertising platform to enhance performance on available ad slots and ultimately increase CTR for customers and ROI for the company.
